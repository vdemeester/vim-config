Vim is my editor of choice. I mostly use it over emacs because of the different
mode and the shortcuts (I used to work with emacs few years ago but I found the
CTRL-â€¦ shortcut not really user friendly for me).

## Basic information

My Vim configuration highlights are the following :

* Not compatible (`set nocompatible`)
* Host-based sub-configuration loading (to specify specific stuff for any host)
  * a Quick bepow remapping for hosts that have bepo keymap
* Solarized colorscheme
* Usage of pathogen with the following bundle :
  * ack
  * command-t
  * fugitive
  * gundo
  * narrow
  * nerdcommenter
  * OrgMode
  * QFixToggle
  * snipmate
  * surround
  * syntastic
  * taglist
  * unimpaired
  * markdown

I tried to comment the file(s) as much as I can. It is an *always* work in 
progress.
